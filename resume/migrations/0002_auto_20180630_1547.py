         interpreting the world. Our minds, having been shaped by the pragmatic
         hand of evolution, are incapable of processing the totality of the world
         around us, and they consequently operate by making groupings, reductions,
         approximations, eliminations. The integral of these simplifications is
         what might be called a world view. World views are the result of the
         complex interfacing of the individual and society. I like to learn about
         these interpretive frameworks both on the individual and the societal
